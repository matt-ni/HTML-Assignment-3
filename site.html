	<h2>Chocolate causes <span class="obesity">OBESITY<span></h2>
	<p>If you are an avid chocolate eater, you better stop eating it so often. You could get obese and that is not very healthy, dude. However, there are alternatives, such as white chocolate and dark chocolate, that do not contain as much fat and sugar as normal commercial milk chocolate. They are still delicious.</p>
